Serial communication C-library for ARM-Cortex-M3 based STM32 MCUs and MSP430G2553 MCUs
======================================================================================


Introduction
------------

"libserial" is part of "libemb". It provides a simple to use API for configuring and using the first USART as an UART on the STM32 or USCI_A UART on the MSP430G2553. The STM32 version of the library depends on "libopencm3" for accessing the STM32 HW. It has no dependencies to other "libemb" libraries.  

For detailed building instructions see the top-level README of "libemb"
