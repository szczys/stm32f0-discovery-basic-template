Console IO C-library for ARM-Cortex-M3 based STM32 MCUs and MSP430G2553 MCUs
============================================================================


Introduction
------------

"libconio" is part of "libemb". It provides a simple to use API for writing text to a console. Currently the console is the first USART on the STM32 or USCI_A on the MSP430.  The library is not HW dependend since the HW part is provided by "libserial". Thus, this library is dependend on "libserial" form the "libemb" project. 

For detailed building instructions see the top-level README of "libemb"
